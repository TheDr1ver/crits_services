The MISP service works for every top-level object. It grabs Indicators related 
to a specific TLO and leverages PyMISP to submit them to a MISP instance
accessible from the CRITs server.

Its code is based heavily on the Relationships service as well as a few
snippets from the Data Miner service to allow for the instant creation of
related indicators before submission.

PLEASE NOTE:

This code needs a LOT of cleanup! Blame that on my hatred of JQuery...

Also, the "To IDS" feature may not work properly until the pip
version of pymisp is updated. Alternatively, the following appears to work on
MISP version 2.4.69:

git clone https://github.com/CIRCL/PyMISP.git && cd PyMISP
git checkout becaeca
git checkout -b old-schema
python setup.py install
