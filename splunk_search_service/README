The Splunk Search service works against Samples, Emails, and Raw Data.
It will grab all metadata of the top-level object (TLO) and use that data to run 
predetermined Splunk searches found in searches.py.

Additionally, it has the option to parse out the contents of the TLO, and use 
any domains, IPs, email addresses, hashes, or URLs it may find in additional 
Splunk searches.

There is also an option to exclude certain filetypes matching a given regex
if the service is launched based on a triage, rather than being run manually.

For example, if an email is uploaded that contains multiple JPEG attachments 
(for which a Splunk search of their hash may not be necessary in most cases),
when the JPEGs are added to CRITs as Sample TLOs, and Splunk is set to run on
triage, the default regex will tell the service not to execute those Splunk 
searches. However, if it is determined later that running those searches for a
particular JPEG may be of some use, manually launching the service will run
the searches.
