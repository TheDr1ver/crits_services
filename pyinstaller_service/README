The pyinstaller service will run the archive_viewer against a binary in an
attempt to find out more information about a binary.

For each object found with a type of "s", it will attempt to extract it, decode
it, add it as Raw Data, and relate it back to the Sample.

NOTE: For this to work make sure to add a new Raw Data Type called "Python"
      (with the capital). It uses this when adding Raw Data and will fail if
      the DataType isn't available.
